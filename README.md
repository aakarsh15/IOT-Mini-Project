IoT Bicycle Signalling System
Introduction:
This project involves the creation of an IoT bicycle signalling system using an Arduino Uno board, IR sensors, and an 8x8 dot matrix LED grid. The system allows cyclists to easily signal their turns, stops, and other maneuvers to nearby drivers, enhancing overall safety on the road.

Project Description:
The IoT bicycle signalling system consists of the following components:

Arduino Uno board
IR sensors (2)
8x8 dot matrix LED grid

The IR sensors are mounted on the bicycle to detect the motion of the cyclist’s hands. When motion is detected, the system activates the appropriate LED signal on the 8x8 dot matrix LED grid to indicate the cyclist's intended maneuver (left turn, right turn, or stop).

Materials Required:
Arduino Uno board
IR sensors (2)
8x8 dot matrix LED grid
Connecting wires
Battery or power source

Setup and Installation:
Connect the IR sensors to digital pins on the Arduino Uno board.
Connect the 8x8 dot matrix LED grid to the Arduino Uno board using appropriate pins.
Upload the provided Arduino code to the Arduino Uno board using the Arduino IDE.
Power the system using a battery or external power source.

Usage:
Mount the IR sensors on the bicycle handlebars.
Turn on the IoT bicycle signalling system.
Begin cycling and use hand signals as usual.
The system will detect hand motions and activate the corresponding LED signals on the grid.

Results:

Future Scope: 
Integration with smart city infrastructure
Collaboration with bicycle manufacturers for direct integration into bicycles

Limitations:
Limited visibility of LED signals in bright sunlight
Limited power supply lifespan
Limited weather resistance
Durability of components over time
